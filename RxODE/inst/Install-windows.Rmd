`RxODE` installion under R for Windows
====================================

These notes briefly describe steps to properly install `RxODE` and to
ensure Rtools (http://cran-r.project.org/bin/windows/Rtoos) are properly 
configured to avoid compilation issues during the use of `RxODE`. 

In a nutshell, installing `RxODE` is very straight forwad, but installing
and configuring Rtools is a bit more delicate and you need to 
carefully follow the instructions in the "R Installation and Adminstration" 
manual, in particular Section 6.3, and Appendix D "The Windows Toolset". 
We point out a couple of details worth extra attention.  Please read on.

Steps:
------

1. Install the appropriate Rtools for your R for Windows version,
   e.g., Rtools 3.2 for R versions 3.1.x through 3.2.x (for full details
   see http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools). A couple of 
   important details:

   * Make sure Rtools and R for Windows use the same architecture, either
     32- or 64-bit.
     
   * NB: Make sure your system `PATH` includes the gcc toolchain appropiate
     folder `libexec` executables, e.g., 
      `C:<Rtools-dir>\gcc-<version>\libexec\gcc\i686-w64-mingw32\<version>\;`
     where `C:<Rtools-dir>` refers to the folder where you have installed
     `Rtools` and `<version>` is the version of the GNU C complier in 
     Rtools.

2.  Obtain the `RxODE` package, either from github or CRAN 

    * CRAN. Use the usual method of installing CRAN pacakges, either 
      through the R GUI or at the command line use, say,
      `install.packages("RxODE", lib="C:/Rlib")`.

    * Github. First install the `devtools` package (if needed) and 
      then `RxODE` from GitHub.  Make sure that the library folder where you 
      install `RxODE` has no embeded spaces (see question 4.1 in the
      "R for Windows FAQ" and the pointers therein).
 
      ``` 
      install.packages("devtools")
      library("devtools", lib = "C:/Rlib")
      install_github("hallowkm/RxODE/RxODE")
      ```

3. Test the `RxODE` installation:

    ``` 
    library("RxODE", lib = "C:/Rlib")
    demo("demo1","RxODE")
    ```

If the demo runs without error, click on the plot window and see if a new plot comes 
up each time. If so, `RxODE` has been installed correctly.

See `browseVignettes("RxODE")` for an extended example on using `RxODE` for simulations.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. A potential error under Windows is

```
mod1 <- RxODE(model = ode, modName = "mod1") 

C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-32~1.0/etc/x64/Makeconf:204: warning: overriding commands for target `.m.o' 
C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-32~1.0/etc/x64/Makeconf:197: warning: ignoring old commands for target `.m.o' 
C:\PROGRA~2\GnuWin32\bin\make.exe: Interrupt/Exception caught (code = 0xc00000fd, addr = 0x4227d3) 
Warning message: 
running command 'make -f "Makevars" -f "C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-32~1.0/etc/x64/Makeconf" -f "C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-32~1.0/share/make/winshlib.mk" SHLIB="c:/data/mod1.d/mod1.dll" PKG_LIBS='-LC:/Users//xxxx/Documents/R/win-library/3.2/RxODE/libs/x64 -lodeaux -lRblas -lgfortran' WIN=64 TCLBIN=64 OBJECTS="c:/data/mod1.d/mod1.o c:/data/mod1.d/call_dvode.o"' had status 255 
Error in cmpMgr$compile() : 
error loading dll file c:/data/mod1.d/mod1.dll 
In addition: Warning message: 
running command 'C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-32~1.0/bin/R CMD SHLIB c:/data/mod1.d/mod1.c c:/data/mod1.d/call_dvode.o -LC:/Users/xxxx/Documents/R/win-library/3.2/RxODE/libs/x64 -lodeaux -lRblas -lgfortran' had status 1 
```

The cause of such an error is typically an improperly installed `Rtools`, 
namely, failing to update the `PATH` system variable to include the `libexec`
as indicated in Step 1 above.

2. Another potential error is when `RxODE` is installed into a folder whose name
   includes spaces.  You may see something like

```
m1 <- RxODE(model = ode, modName = "m1")
Error in file(con, "r") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning messages:
1: running command 'C:/Program Files/R/R-3.1.1/library/RxODE/bin/i386/tran.exe C:/Temp/FMD/m1.d/model.txt C:/Temp/FMD/m1.d/m1.c C:/Temp/FMD/m1.d/ 2>C:/Temp/FMD/m1.d/error.txt' had status 127 
2: In file(con, "r") :
  cannot open file 'C:/Temp/FMD/m1.d/m1.c': No such file or directory
```

Notice that path `C:/Program Files/...` contains a space.  The workaround for this
issue is to install `RxODE` on a different folder, say, `C:\Rlib`.
